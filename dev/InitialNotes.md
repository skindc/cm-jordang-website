site title - NCV Diagnostics

header - Company Logo on the left side and functioning page links to the right side (Home, Our Specialties, About Us, Make an Appointment, Contact Us)

body - 
Underneath header would be:
image gallery that user can click through (pictures will be provided) with a short ‘welcome’ message. I could edit the content here if you just put in ‘welcome message’

below that would be “Our Services” h1
“What we specialize in” h2

then an attractive way to highlight these services:

Workers Compensation

Motor Vehicle Accident

Diagnosis

Impact Testing

Behavioral Health

Nerve Conduction Studies

the website (https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery) has the perfect icons to add here and they are all free and easy to use.
——
Then a footer with a sitemap to link to the other pages, contact information (I will provide).
 
I will send you a zipped folder that has a starter file for the HTML. Please start from this. It also has the CSS file started with media queries included to make the site responsive and viewable on mobile. The folder will also have images included. 

I should be able to answer more questions tomorrow
